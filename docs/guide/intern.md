## ToLook

    Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and Design Patterns
    Decorators, Generators, and Context Managers
    Advanced Data Structures and Algorithms
    Exception Handling and Debugging
    Multithreading and Multiprocessing
    Network Programming
    Web Scraping and Data Extraction
    Working with APIs (REST, SOAP, etc.)
    Building Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs)
    Machine Learning and Deep Learning Libraries (TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, etc.)


    Data Structures:
        Stacks, Queues, and Deques
        Linked Lists
        Trees (Binary Trees, AVL Trees, etc.)
        Heaps
        Hash Tables
        Graphs (Representation, Traversal, etc.)
    
    Algorithms:
        Sorting Algorithms (QuickSort, MergeSort, HeapSort, etc.)
        Search Algorithms (Binary Search, Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search, etc.)
        Dynamic Programming (Longest Common Subsequence, Longest Increasing Subsequence, etc.)
        Divide and Conquer (Closest Pair of Points, Matrix Multiplication, etc.)
        Greedy Algorithms (Huffman Coding, Fractional Knapsack Problem, etc.)
        Backtracking (N-Queens Problem, Sudoku Solver, etc.)
        These subtopics cover various types of data structures and algorithms and their implementation in Python. Understanding these concepts and being able to implement them efficiently is an important aspect of advanced Python programming.
